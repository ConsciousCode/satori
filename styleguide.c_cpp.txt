Blocks with no statements begin on their own line.
Goto is allowed provided:
* It doesn't create loops
* Alternatives are less clear (e.g. branch joining)
* Its name is of the form LABEL_<name>
Function names use snake_case, method names use camelCase
Pointers are type-oriented unless multiple pointers are being declared (type* x; type *a, *b)
Use -Wpedantic and -Werror
Never use switch-default in switches for enum values.
Use auto whenever you can get away with it.
Multi-line method chaining should place the dot operator at the end of the line (guarantees no automatic semicolon insertion)
