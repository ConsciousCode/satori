Indentation uses tab characters only for logical tabulation (no alignment) and no leading spaces.
Multi-line variable declaration lists have an empty first line, comma/semicolon at the end.
 var
 	x = 1,
 	y = 2,
 	z = 3;

funCall(), funCall(x), funCall(x, y, ...)
if(x) {
}
else if(x) {
}
else {
}
for(;;) {}
do {} while(x);
while(x) {}
Statement blocks begin on the line of their statement prefixed by one space with the body indented once and the closing brace on its own line.
Operators generally have spaces surrounding them. Exceptions:
* multiplicatives: x*y x/y x%y
* function default parameter values void f(int x=0, int y=1)
// Comment on following code
/// Indicate an important section
/**
 * Documentation
**/
Lines should never exceed 80 characters. Continuations of an expression should be indented. Multi-line function calls and blocks have the closing parenthesis on a separate line, with same-indentation being combined into one. Ex:
callback(() => {
}, 10)
